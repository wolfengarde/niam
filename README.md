# This is New Independent Administrative Markup (NIAM), version 1.0.

NIAM is a legislative document markup based on XML that is built for the new era.

## Why?
Document markups like the Office Open XML (any .docx file), ODT work, but they aren't meant for such stuff to be honest. Other parliaments like the US Congress use similar technologies, and its about time we do too.

## What advantage do I get from NIAM...

### as a lawmaker?
- You get to write your laws without worrying about formats, font sizes, or anything. Just focus on the content.

### as a paralegal/legal professional/lawyer?
- You get to efficiently cite laws.
